Model,Key Hyperparameters,Rationale
Linear Regression,None (Ordinary Least Squares),"Simple, interpretable baseline"
Random Forest,"n_estimators, max_depth",Handles non-linearity and interactions
Gradient Boosting,"learning_rate, n_estimators",Effective with structured data; mitigates overfitting
SVM,"C (Regularization), kernel",Effective for non-linear boundaries
